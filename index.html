                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>
                3D Printing is a really fun hobby that is worth saving up for. You can make a lot of things with 3D
                prints. You can make mini figures, prototypes, cosplay outfits, and so much more. It is expensive to
                    buy a 3D printer but it is worth saving up for.

        <p>3D prints can sometimes be painted to give the figure a more realistic look. This baby yoda was orginally
            a single color but was painted to make it look exactly like the real Baby Yoda (Grogu).</p>
